# my-first-agent

A minimal OSPREY project with one MCP server and a mock control system.

## Quick Start

```bash
claude
```

Ask the agent to read control system channels — it uses the mock connector,
so any channel name works without real hardware.

## Configuration

- `config.yml` — project settings (control system type, API providers)
- `.claude/` — Claude Code rules, hooks, and MCP server configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent behavior instructions (edit to customize)

## Next Steps

- Enable writes: set `writes_enabled: true` in `config.yml`
- Connect to real hardware: change `control_system.type` from `mock` to `epics`
- Upgrade to the full `control_assistant` template for channel finder, logbook, and archiver
